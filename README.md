# Dr-PoGO: Direct Radar Pose-Graph Optimization

Dr-PoGO is a radar-based SLAM framework (preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.04806)).
It combines **Direct Radar Odometry (DRO)** with **RaPlace** loop-closure detection and a **pose-graph optimizer** to produce globally consistent trajectories from FMCW radar data.

This branch contains a ROS 2 implementation of the full Dr-PoGO pipeline for online operation and real-time visualization in RViz2.
The branch `offline` contains the standalone version of the pipeline for offline processing as used in the original paper.

## Architecture overview


| Node | Language | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| `boreas_player` | Python | Replays a Boreas sequence (radar + IMU) as ROS 2 topics |
| `dro_node` | Python | Doppler-aware direct radar odometry |
| `raplace_node` | Python | Loop-closure detection using RaPlace |
| `registration_node` | Python | Feature-based registration and direct refinement of loop-closure transformations |
| `pogo_node` | C++ | Pose-graph optimizer (Ceres) |

## Dependencies

### ROS 2 (provided by your ROS 2 installation)
- `rclpy`, `rclcpp`
- `sensor_msgs`, `nav_msgs`, `geometry_msgs`, `std_msgs`
- `message_filters`
- `cv_bridge`
- `yaml-cpp`

### C++ libraries (system)
- [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org/)
- [Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)

These can typically be installed via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install libceres-dev libeigen3-dev` on Ubuntu).

### Python (pip)
Install all Python dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` covers: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `scikit-image`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `PyYAML`, `pyboreas`, `torch`, `torchvision`.

## Build

First clone this repository into your ROS 2 workspace's `src/` directory, then build with:
```bash
cd <your_ros2_workspace>/src
git clone git@github.com:utiasASRL/dre.git
```

Then build the workspace with:
```bash
cd <your_ros2_workspace>
colcon build --packages-select dre --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

`--symlink-install` is required: it installs config files as symlinks back to `src/`, so editing a config takes effect immediately without rebuilding.

## Usage

### 1. Prepare the config files

`config/config_dro.yaml` ships populated with Boreas RT defaults (also kept as a reference preset under `config/templates/`) — edit it directly, or restore it from the template if needed.
You can also customize the RaPlace, registration, and pose-graph config files if desired (all parameters should have reasonable defaults though).

Not that by default, the registration node is set to use GPU if available. Depending on your hardware and the size of the local maps, this may slow down the processing of DRO's odometry (both nodes can compete for GPU resources). If you want to disable GPU usage for loop registration, simply set `use_gpu_if_available: false` in the `config/config_registration.yaml` file. It will be slower to compute the loop registration (using only 1 CPU thread), but DRO's behaviour will be more predictable.


### 2. Launch the full pipeline

```bash
ros2 launch dre dr_pogo_launch.py
```

This starts all four estimation nodes plus an RViz2 visualizer with the bundled `config/rviz.rviz` preset.
(`dre_launch.py` is currently identical — it's the forward-looking entry point for the full
DRE pipeline once mapping/localization nodes are added.)

**Note:** The DRO code will attempt to leverage torch compilation if the `config/config_dro.yaml` file contains the following parameters:
```yaml
radar:
  nb_azimuths: XXX
  doppler_enabled: true/false
  resolution: Y.YYYY
```
If you chose to enable compilation, the initialization of the `dro_node` will take significantly longer (something like 30sec?). When the comilation is done and DRO is ready to process data, you should see the following message in the terminal:
```[INFO] [dro_node]: DRO ready
```
If you want to disable compilation, simply remove one of the above parameters from the config file (e.g., `resolution`).

### 3. Play a Boreas sequence

```bash
ros2 run dre boreas_player -p <path_to_sequence> -r <playback_rate>
# Example:
ros2 run dre boreas_player -p /data/boreas/boreas-2024-12-03-12-54 -r 1.0
```

You can also make it play as fast as DRO allows by setting `-r 0` (preventing to wait between messages if your hardware is fast enough to process the data faster than real-time, and allows for slower hardware to keep up by slowing down the playback rate as needed).

## Configuration

All YAML config files live under `config/`.

| File | Node | Key parameters |
|------|------|----------------|
| `config_dro.yaml` | `dro_node` | Sensor extrinsics (`T_axle_radar`), range limits, GP lengthscales |
| `config_raplace.yaml` | `raplace_node` | `min_time_diff`, `max_odom_drift`, `max_img_size` |
| `config_registration.yaml` | `registration_node` | `lowe_ratio`, `ransac_thr`, `max_img_size`, `use_gpu_if_available` |
| `config_pogo.yaml` | `pogo_node` | Odometry/loop noise std-devs, loss scales, `estimate_bias` |


## Custom messages

| Message | Fields |
|---------|--------|
| `RadarInfo` | Radar scan metadata (timestamps, frequency, etc.) |
| `LocalMapInfo` | Accumulated local map header, resolution, 2-D pose (`x`, `y`, `theta`) |
| `LoopCandidate` | Query/candidate timestamps, match score, image paths, local map resolution |

## Output

Atop ROS2 topics shown in RViz, Dr-PoGO outputs the odometry and pose-graph optimized trajectories in files in an output directory specified in the launch file (default is in the install space under `<ros2_ws>/install/dre/share/dre/<sequence_id>/`):
- `odometry_result/<sequence_id>.txt`: DRO odometry trajectory using the Boreas format.
- `pose_graph_traj.txt`: Pose-graph optimized trajectory in with `timestamp(us) x y theta` format.


### TODOs

- [ ] Making the dense loop registration refinement faster !! (need to profile first)
- [ ] Improving documentation
- [ ] Looking at making DRO even faster? (real time on my RTX 500 Mobile GPU (30W), so not a priority)
- [ ] Adding the 3D odometry output as for 3DRO
